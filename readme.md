The Auld Tomes: Bamboozling is a first-person Action RPG in development for [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). That project is closed-source, and this repository is meant for public-facing resources. This main branch will act as a directory and FAQ, while orphaned branches contain the github.io site.
