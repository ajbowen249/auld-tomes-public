# How to Play

*Þe Auld Tomes: Bamboozling* is played from a first-person perspective with contextual menus.

## Controls

### Mouse and Keyboard (Recommended)

Use `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` to walk and strafe. With focus in the game window, use the mouse to turn your perspective.

`Left-Click` the mouse to interact with doors and NPCs when prompted. When unarmed or equipped with a melee weapon, `left-click` when prompted to attack. `Left-Click` at any time with a ranged attack (such as a spell) equipped to fire forward.

`Right-Click` to bring up the Player Menu. `Left-Click` to select items, and use the scroll wheel to navigate long lists. `Right-Click` again to close the menu, or back out from nested menus.

Tabbed menus have `left-click`able icons along the bottom row. `A` and `D` can be used to quickly change tabs.

If desired, the `Arrow Keys` may also be used to walk and turn, and to navigate menus. When using arrow keys to navigate a tab menu, arrow all the way down to the bottom row to gain focus on the tab icons.

### Mobile

Use the `✥` to walk and turn.

Use `X` to interact with doors and NPCs when prompted. When unarmed or equipped with a melee weapon, press `X` when prompted to attack. Press `X` at any time with a ranged attack (such as a spell) equipped to fire forward.

Use `O` to bring up the Player Menu. Press `↑` and `↓` to move up and down lists, and `X` to select items. Press `O` again to close the menu, or back out from nested menus. In tabbed menus, `↓` all the way down to the bottom row to gain focus on the tab icons, use `←` and `→` to change tabs, and `↑` to return focus to the menu.


## The Player Menu

The player menu has 5 tabs:

### Settings

The Settings tab has toggles for sound effects and music. It also allows the game to be saved.

> **Note:** Games are currently only saved over a single slot, and the button will always overwrite any other progress.

### Inventory

Inventory allows the player to view, use, equip, or discard all items on their person. Select an item to bring up a context menu with a full description. Use usable items to gain their effect. Most usable items are consumed on use. Discarded items cannot be retrieved. Equipped items will be highlighted in the menu with a green circle.

### Spells

Spells are equipped just like inventory items. The player starts out with no spells. To learn a spell, the player must acquire a Spell Tome. The Spell Tome must be `use`d from the Inventory tab, and then it will appear in the Spells tab. *Spell Tomes are not consumed, because books don't disappear when you're done reading them, last I checked.*

### Journal

The Journal tab's top item allows the player to bring up their Atlas to select a travel location. Any active quests will be listed as well, and selecting them will bring up a sub-menu with a description and list of tasks.

### Stats

Stats shows the player's current properties as set up in character creation. When level progression is implemented, it will be the interface through which the player upgrades their stats.

## What to Do

Your first task will be to escape prison. Make your way to the end of the hallway after speaking to your fellow inmate, turn the corner, and reach the door, fighting the guards if you wish.

From there, the public demo consists of a handful of locations to discover and two completable quests. Speak to NPCs and use the Journal tab of the menu to find goals. Once you've completed the two quests, you've done about all there is to do in the demo, for now.
